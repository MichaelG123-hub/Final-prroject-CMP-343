I am replicating a tutorial from youtube. 

original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPuLnzSjPLE

I am building an fullstack app using Node.js, MySQL, react, and Postman app.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

We will fetch books from a database(MySQL)

We can create a new book, delete a specific book or even update a book.

Steps I took:

I stared with downloading MySQL and creating a database called tests, to test the database,
that creates a book with an id, title, description, and cover.png. 

Using the postman app, I created a post request with the path /books and created 
SQL query to insert a new book in the books table. I used an array with values to match the 
three columns title, desc, and cover. using postman and clicking the post option, while my back-end is running, I used the url localhost:3000/books and was able to see I was successful at posting an example book or testing a post for it. making sure everything is connected. 

you can use npm start to start the back-end. (work in progress)
