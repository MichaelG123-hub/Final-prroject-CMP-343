I am building an fullstack app using Node.js, MySQL, and react. 

We will fetch books from a database(MySQL)

We can create a new book, delete a specific book or even update a book.

Steps I took:

I stared with downloading MySQL and createing a database called tests, to test the database,
that creates a book with an id, title, description, and cover.png.
