I am replicating a tutorial from youtube. 

original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPuLnzSjPLE

I am building an fullstack app using Node.js, MySQL, and react. 

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

We will fetch books from a database(MySQL)

We can create a new book, delete a specific book or even update a book.

Steps I took:

I stared with downloading MySQL and creating a database called tests, to test the database,
that creates a book with an id, title, description, and cover.png. 

you can use npm start to start the back-end. (work in progress)
